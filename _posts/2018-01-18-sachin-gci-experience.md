![Hello World!](http://clickrightng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/hello-world.jpg)

As I look back now, November 28th was my best day of 2017. It was late at night, 10:30 if my memory is right, and I had school the next day. However, I was really, really excited. A minute later, I refreshed my page, and Google Code-In had officially started. With a silent _Woohoo_, I proceeded to fill up all the required information. As soon all the formalities were completed, I scanned the organisation list for the one that I had decided to go with the day the list of organisations was released. 

I love (and now have a newfound respect for) Java, JavaScript and Android. It just so happened that the JBoss Community was one of the only organisation to have all 3 of these programming languages. On further reading, I found out that JBoss was a child organisation of RedHat, a company that I had some experience with. I realized then and there that the JBoss Community was the perfect fit for me. 

Getting _back_ to post-November 28th, I was thoroughly enjoying Google Code-In. I looked at it more as a learning experience than a competition, and that mindset actually helped me. I was inquisitive and eager to learn more, which made me take up more and more tasks, regardless of whether I knew how to complete them or not, and actually try to focus on the quality of what I was submitting, rather than simply scrape through the task with the bare minimum. I look back now and laugh at a few tasks that had really complicated jargon in their titles, but turned out to be elementary in their execution. In fact after a while, I started to choose tasks that sounded alien to me rather than simple ones because I wanted to learn as much as possible.

I made new friends along the way, learnt a lot of new stuff, and spent a lot of time bent over my computer screen. Naturally, I loved every single second of it.

In conclusion, Google Code-In was one of the biggest fun and learning experience of my life. I truly will others to experience this wonderful event.
Before I end, I want to give a big shoutout to all the mentors of the JBoss Community for taking so much time off from your busy schedules to help us students. I know it wasnâ€™t easy, and I really want to thank you for all that you have taught me.

Happy coding!
